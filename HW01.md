### 1\. Classify each of the following declartive sentences as

> 1. An open sentence
> 2. a true statement
> 3. a false statement

a\. 25^2 = 2 _ 3 _ 100

> 2. true

b\j. `x > y`

> 1. open

c\. 0 is even

> 2. true

d\. `(1/2)^2 > (1/2)

> 3. false

e\. `3n + 5` is even

> 3. false

### 5\. For an interger `n`, consider the following open sentences:

> `P(n) = n^2 - 4n < 0`
>
> `Q(n) = n^3 - n = 0`

a\. `P(n) AND Q(n)`

> [-1]

b\. `P(n) OR Q(n)`

> (-inf, 0] U [1] U (4, inf)

c\. `P(n) XOR Q(n)`

> (-inf, -1) U (-1, 0] U [1] U [4, inf)

### 7\. For the statements

> `P: 4^2 != 2^4`
>
> `Q: 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 * 2 * 3`

a. `~P`

> TRUE

b. `P OR Q`

> TRUE

c. `P AND Q`

> FALSE

d. `P => Q`

> TRUE

### 11. Consider the statement

> S: _If I get paid today, then I'm going to the party tonight._

a. Assuming that S is true and that **I got paid today** does that mean I'm going to the party tonight?

> Yes

b. Assuming that S is true and that I went to the party tonight, does that mean that I got paid today?

> No

c. Assuming that S is true and that I didn't get paid today, does that mean that I don't go to the other party tonight?

> No

### 13. Consider the following two statements

> `P: I didn't get the job`
>
> `Q: I will go back to college`

a. `P => Q`

> If I didn't get the job, I'll go back to college

b. `(~P) V Q`

> I'll get the job, or I will go back to college

c. `(~P) => (~Q)

> If I get a job, I won't go back to college

d. `P AND Q`

> I didn't get the job and I went back to college

### 18. For the statements `P` and `Q`, construct the truth table for `((~P) OR Q) => P`

| P   | Q   | ~P  | ((~P) OR Q) | ((~P) OR Q) => P |
| --- | --- | --- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1   | 1   |     | 1           | 1                |
| 1   |     |     |             | 1                |
| 1   | 1   |     | 1           | 1                |
| 1   |     |     |             | 1                |
|     | 1   | 1   | 1           |
|     |     | 1   | 1           |
|     | 1   | 1   | 1           |
|     |     | 1   | 1           |

### 21. Without using a truth tablem, show for statements P and Q that

> `~(P OR ((~P) AND Q)) == (~P) AND (~Q)`

> ~(`P OR ((~P) AND Q)`) == (~P) AND (~Q) `// Distributive Rule`

> ~( (`P OR (~P)`) AND (P AND Q)) == (~P) AND (~Q)

> `~`(TRUE AND (P AND Q)) == (~P) AND (~Q) `// De Morgan's Law`

> `~TRUE` OR ~(P AND Q)) == (~P) AND (~Q)

> `FALSE OR `~(P AND Q)) == (~P) AND (~Q)

> `~`(P AND Q)) == (~P) AND (~Q) 

> (~P) AND (~Q) == (~P) AND (~Q)
